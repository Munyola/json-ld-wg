# Open Actions for Working Group Members

These are the open actions recorded during [Working Group meetings](./index), linked to the original action setting in the meeting minutes.

The actions themselves are stored in a separate [JSON file](../assets/actions.json), and are updated when the meeting minutes are generated. Unfortunately, there is currently no way to interactively mark the actions as closed; this should be done by editing the JSON file in the [github repo](https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-wg/tree/master/assets/actions.json) by either removing the relevant entry or setting its `open` flag to `false`.
