> *Benjamin Young:* Protected Term Definition - [https://w3c.github.io/json-ld-syntax/#protected-term-definitions](https://w3c.github.io/json-ld-syntax/#protected-term-definitions)

**Benjamin Young:** we're discussing 136. There are some already-merged PRs and there are some tests  
… this topic is our exclusive focus for today  
… because this would really help VCWG  
… this piece of work is valuable to support them _NOT_ taking JSON-LD out of the spec  
… let's start with a summary of the editorial work  

**Gregg Kellogg:** I think there are some PRs that have been completed on the syntax side  

**Pierre-Antoine Champin:** all related PRs have been merged  

**Gregg Kellogg:** I think we still need to add the mechanism that would disallow unsealing via @context:null  

**Dave Longley:** we're just looking exactly what gkellogg said  
… what's currently there would allow for the protection to be removed merely via @context:null anywhere in the doc  
… which doesn't do what we actually need from the feature  
… the point is to be able to call out terms so that people using the context can be minimal with processing on those terms  
… with but one little change, we can accomplish that  
… just by restricting to a scoped context  
… that will provide the needed assurance  

**Pierre-Antoine Champin:** to be clear, the `@context:null` could be on any protected definition?  

**Dave Longley:** correct  
… should not complicate implementations  

**Rob Sanderson:** if a `@context:null` is encountered elsewhere than in a property-scoped context, it changes from wiping out everything to just wiping out non-protected terms?  

**Dave Longley:** no, that should be an error under our change  
… because that would be trying to remove protection illegally  

**Rob Sanderson:** that seems backwards-incompatible  
… it changes the meaning of `@context:null`  

**Dave Longley:** well, no, because there were never protected terms before  

**Rob Sanderson:** 2nd opinion would be desirable  

**Gregg Kellogg:** what we had done before was not throw errors but issue warnings  

> *David I. Lehn:* protectedMode and tests here: [https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-api/pull/69](https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-api/pull/69)

**Gregg Kellogg:** dlehn has an issue for a "protected mode" flag which would switch between errors and warnings  
… are you putting those together or something totally new?  

**Dave Longley:** we've implemented both, and we're okay with either, but we think that throwing an error would be cleaner, but we can default to the warning  
… and in that case, the protected terms would just not be redefined  
… we have tests for either case  
… but we thought that defaulting to error would be cleaner  

**Pierre-Antoine Champin:** just wanted to point out that property-scoped context aren't in 1.0  
… `@context:null` in a property-scoped definitions simply doesn't exist now,  
… so we can't break extant JSON-LD  
… [then changes his mind]  

**Gregg Kellogg:** the only way to provoke this is via a protected term, which didn't exist in 1.0  
… so you couldn't produce this error that way  
… I think that adding flags to the API is waffling  
… we should choose a party to go to  
… in my own processor I run testing in a "validation" mode which is strict  
… this might be such a thing  
… but for conformance, maybe we should just pick a road here  

> *Rob Sanderson:* Here's when it breaks 1.0:   `{ @context: [ "1.1-context-with-protected", "existing-´1.0-context-with-null"] ... }`

**Rob Sanderson:** if the intent is that extant 1.0 contexts work as written  
… then adding "protected" that can't be reset via `@context:null`  
… won't work if a 1.0 context began with `@context:null` but is used at a point where protected terms are in scope  

**Gregg Kellogg:** it used to be that we run in 1.0 until we see a marker for 1.1, but we now start in 1.1  

> *Benjamin Young:* current processing model triggering definition [https://w3c.github.io/json-ld-syntax/#dfn-processing-mode](https://w3c.github.io/json-ld-syntax/#dfn-processing-mode)

**Rob Sanderson:** so 1.0 contexts still work as expected and danbri won't come gunning for us?  
… or not?  
… are we going to get objections from Google or MS ?  
… if we can put this into the set of allowable incompatibilities  
… I won't stand in the way  

**Ivan Herman:** to prepare for a possible objection, is it worth to add a note to the document making that clear?  

> *Rob Sanderson:* +1 from me to calling it out specifically

**Gregg Kellogg:** to say that this is a 1.1 feature?  

**Ivan Herman:** question may come up, and we can preempt them in this case  
… either in the spec or the best practices doc  

**Benjamin Young:** if it risks a formal objection we should put it in the docs  

**Gregg Kellogg:** it's not necessary to qualify generating an error if the attempt to clear out the context with a protected-mode term in scope for 1.1.  

> *Adam Soroka:* [and I lost the end of the thought]

**Gregg Kellogg:** that might be a point at which we could add a note  
… that this error cannot be generated from a proc running in 1.0 mode  

**David Newbury:** when we're talking about 1.0 v 1.1 mode for compatibility  

> *Adam Soroka:* .. we're talking about the doc being processed

**David Newbury:** not the context of the context  

**Gregg Kellogg:** documents aren't 1.0 or 1.1  
… the processing is 1.0 or 1.1  
… contriolled by `@version` in the context  

> *Benjamin Young:* the `@version` definition [https://w3c.github.io/json-ld-syntax/#h-note-1](https://w3c.github.io/json-ld-syntax/#h-note-1)

**Gregg Kellogg:** but that can happen in any context  

**David Newbury:** right, but that doesn't change the context, right, just its interpretation in the context (different use of the word) in which it is being processed?  

**Rob Sanderson:** I understand the pattern of restricting to property-scoped contexts  
… but is that the limit?  

**Dave Longley:** it's acceptable to put protected type-scoped definition  
… but you can't _clear_ terms there  
… that would lead to multiple inheritance  
… think of protected terms as a "base class" for anything in the doc  
… appending a type to any node would change the semantics  
… which misses the whole point, which is to make processing easier  

**Rob Sanderson:** we can't limit the types assigned to a resource  
… and type-scoped defns in this way could lead to collisions.  

**Gregg Kellogg:** I implied something like this in an earlier version  
… what would happen is  
… when you expand based on a property which is a protected term  
… that is when you look for embedded context associated with that term  
… . that is when you could see `@contxt:null`  
… you detect that by calling expansion with some option that includes the term at hand  

**Dave Longley:** we ran into no gotchas  
… we did it with both warning and error  
… it was simple, the hardest part was the warning  
… tracking when you can clear protection or not was actually fairly simple  

**Gregg Kellogg:** ready with a Pull Request?  

**Dave Longley:** not quite, but quite close  

> *Benjamin Young:* [https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-api/pull/69](https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-api/pull/69)

> *Benjamin Young:* Add `@protected` tests and a `protectedMode` flag.

**Dave Longley:** yeah, that looks like the right PR  

> *David I. Lehn:* the related is implementation PR is here: [https://github.com/digitalbazaar/jsonld.js/pull/289](https://github.com/digitalbazaar/jsonld.js/pull/289)

> *Pierre-Antoine Champin:* I can edit the current section on "protected" in the syntax document, to reflect those changes

**Dave Longley:** that PR should cover all the bases  
… clearing things when you should be bale to, when you shouldn't...  

**Gregg Kellogg:** some updates look to be needed  
… some test are failing and it's coming from Digital Bazaar's repo  

**Dave Longley:** we can move the PR, np  

**Benjamin Young:** this PR has the protected mode warning/error flag on the API  
… we can massage that independent of the PR  

**Ivan Herman:** firstly we should formally resolve the issue in a very clear way  
… but also we need a statement or something from this WG making it clear that this is a feature that is frozen and will not be removed  

**Dave Longley:** yes, we need that reassurance  

**Ivan Herman:** we have to produce that  
… a similar situation (JSON-LD being behind) can happen with WoT WG as well  
… they will need the same kind of things  
… we could produce a blog  
… saying that all features in the document are stable in the sense that  
… we don't expect to remove them  
… would that work for you?  

**Dave Longley:** my understanding is that it would  

**Gregg Kellogg:** when we talked about freezing before, I said then that we need to get out a WD  
… I don't think we can point at an editor's draft for such an assurance  
… so what's the timing for that?  

**Ivan Herman:** for a CR, for which you are running right now  
… having a fresh WD from JSON-LD WG should be enough  
… but getting to Rec would mean that isn't enough  
… we have a publishing process through which to go, and it could take 2-3 weeks  

**Dave Longley:** We're already in CR  
… 2-3 weeks doesn't change anything  
… we prefer sooner rather than later  
… this will help us get through a number of issues  

**Ivan Herman:** and helps you with the discussion you are having with commenters  

**Rob Sanderson:** let's say we have a WD within 1-2 weeks  
… and get the feedback  
… then write the blog post saying "No more new features"  
… would be 3-4 weeks  

**Dave Longley:** yes, but TBC all we need is "these features won't be taken out", not "no new features"  

**Rob Sanderson:** if we do hit timeline issues, we could offer something more than a blog post for VCWG in particular  

**Dave Longley:** a simple statement would be acceptable  

**Gregg Kellogg:** we do need to resolve "warnings vs. errors"  

**Rob Sanderson:** we need to discuss that beforehand  

**Dave Longley:** I don't want to prevent people from writing nonstandard implementations that use warnings,  
… I was concerned by not having this behavior be configurable

{: .proposed_resolution}

> *Adam Soroka:* +1

> *Adam Soroka:* me oh, good point

> *Adam Soroka:* [general discussion about how to advance the wording of this propsoal]

**Dave Longley:** don't want to confuse people with wording about when you can use `@context:null`  

**Gregg Kellogg:** also, terms aren't really changed by that action, they are cleared  
… `@context:null` doesn't change terms, it clears them  

**Rob Sanderson:** I thought you didn't need to set `@context:null` to alter a term  

**Gregg Kellogg:** what if you set a term defintion to null?  

**Rob Sanderson:** we can put that off until later  

> *Rob Sanderson:* `{"@context": {"protected": {"@id": "something", "@protected": True}, "extension": {"@context": {"protected": {"@id": "something else"}}}`

**Rob Sanderson:** I believe that given our current definitions, that ^^^ would be acceptable  
… you should be able to set a term directly to something else  

**Dave Longley:** as long as you are property-scoped, you can wipe out everything, but yes, you could go at only a single term  

**Gregg Kellogg:** and 1.0 does allow setting a single term to null

{: .proposed_resolution}

> *Dave Longley:* +1 (of course, setting the context to null within a property scoped context is also allowed)

> *Gregg Kellogg:* +1

> *Rob Sanderson:* +1

**Rob Sanderson:** we could make that a bit clearer as pointed out by dlongely

**Gregg Kellogg:** other than as previously provided  

> *Dave Longley:* +1 to Gregg

> *Dave Longley:* +1 to the proposal

**Benjamin Young:** what we're saying is that it is indeed an error, not a warning

{: #resolution3 .resolution}

**Gregg Kellogg:** for the purpose of best time use we should look at issues on the GitHub management console to find what we need to do to get to a new WD  

**Ivan Herman:** different topic?  

**Benjamin Young:** yeah, I have no other issues

> *Rob Sanderson:* link: [https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-framing/issues/38](https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-framing/issues/38)

**Ivan Herman:** I think I said that if it gets too complicated, we can forget it  

> *Rob Sanderson:* link: [https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-syntax/issues/103](https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-syntax/issues/103)

**Ivan Herman:** #38 was discussed and resolved: what happened there?  

**Benjamin Young:** the resolution sonuds editorial  

**Gregg Kellogg:** these can be open issues in a WD  
… . feels like too much work  

**Rob Sanderson:** we can say that no _more_ open issue will come  

**Ivan Herman:** we would need a nontrivial extension  
… and I am find with closing  

**Ivan Herman:** I will close it after a resolution, just to be correct  

**Rob Sanderson:** propose won't-fix  

> **Proposed resolution: Defer Framing #38 until a future version** *(Rob Sanderson)*
{: .proposed_resolution}

**Ivan Herman:** wasn't there some label for deferring to a future version>?

> *Ivan Herman:* +1

> *Adam Soroka:* [discussion of potential issues to discuss]

**Gregg Kellogg:** i'd like to defer the issues mentioned in that discussions  

**Rob Sanderson:** bigbluehat: agreed  

**Benjamin Young:** do we need to list all these issues?  

**Rob Sanderson:** don't think we need to  

**Pierre-Antoine Champin:** I was thinking about property-based indexing  
… if the WD is meant to reassure VCWG and WoTWG then shouldn't that feature be included in it?  

> *Adam Soroka:* ivan_ yes, but isn't it already in?

**Gregg Kellogg:** is it an open PR?  

**Pierre-Antoine Champin:** yes, but you suggested a significant syntax change  

**Gregg Kellogg:** hopefully we can discuss and decide those on the issue itself, or we will need to discuss it next week  

**Gregg Kellogg:** can we reocrd the specific remaining issues and PRs that merit our attention this week?  

> *Benjamin Young:* [https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-syntax/pull/145](https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-syntax/pull/145)

**Gregg Kellogg:** what pchampin described as needing discussion  

**Gregg Kellogg:** I see that I approved it  

**Pierre-Antoine Champin:** I think you implemented it!  

**Gregg Kellogg:** let's keep discussion on that PR  

**Ivan Herman:** there should be a clear list of issues and PRs that are still pending
