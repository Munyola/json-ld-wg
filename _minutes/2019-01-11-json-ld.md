### 2. 2019 Winter Face-to-Face - February 7-8 in Washington, DC
{: #section2}

**Rob Sanderson:** regarding the upcoming F2F in Washington DC, and the admin shutdown in the US,  
… since people already have their travel booked,  
… I reached out to 4 people for an alternative location.  
… One option is the Folger Shakespeare library, near the library of Congress.  
… The other option is oalition for Networked Information  
… A little further away from the Smithonian than Folger.

**Ivan Herman:** are both of them easy to get to via public transport or foot?  

**Rob Sanderson:** yes  

**Ivan Herman:** then, Rob, you are in the best position to make the decision.  

**Rob Sanderson:** Folger is closer to the Smithonian. Dupont Circle probably is 30' walk.  
… So I'd suggest the Folger.  

**Gregg Kellogg:** what if the gov shutdown is resolved by then?  

**Ivan Herman:** I think Adam suggested that we go the secure way.  

> *Rob Sanderson:* Adam said: "I strongly urge you to accept one of the generous offers from other institutions of cultural heritage in D.C. to host the February face-to-face."

> *Rob Sanderson:* (in an email to Benjamin, me and Ivan)

> **Proposed resolution: move F2F location to Folger due to US government shutdown** *(Benjamin Young)*
{: .proposed_resolution}

**Ivan Herman:** The Folger does us a real favor. It would not be good to accept and then decline the others.

> *Simon Steyskal:* +0

**Ivan Herman:** for people that will not attend, will there be a possibility to dial in,  
… or are we on our own?  

**Rob Sanderson:** if only a few people are to dial in, we can make do with the local wifi.  
… I can ask the Folger if we can have a dedicated laptop for dial in.  

> ***Resolution #2: move F2F location to Folger due to US government shutdown***
{: #resolution2 .resolution}

**Rob Sanderson:** we are not totally off the hook until the Folger confirms. That should be on Monday.  

### 3. Issues
{: #section3}

#### 3.1. HTTP parameters for specifying context or frame (round 2!)
{: #section3-1}

> *Benjamin Young:* [https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-syntax/issues/8](https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-syntax/issues/8)

> - syntax - [https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-syntax/pull/111](https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-syntax/pull/111) (open)
> - framing - [https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-framing/pull/34](https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-framing/pull/34) (merged)
> - api - [https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-api/pull/56](https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-api/pull/56) (ready for review)

**Benjamin Young:** the framing PR is already merged — mostly clerical, regarding IANA registration.  

**Gregg Kellogg:** the PR is about the possibility for a client to specify the contex with which it wishes the retrieved data to be processed.  
… Last week, we discussed this, and realized that dereferencing the value of the profile attribute is something that we don't want to do.  
… I had to rewrite this part. This information is now to be conveyed with a Link header.  
… A consequence is that the context URL can no more be used for content negotiation.  

**Rob Sanderson:** my understanding about the move away from the profile parameter is about the dereferencability?  

**Gregg Kellogg:** not exactly. The RFC indicates that the URI used as profile parameter can be dereferencable, for documentation.  
… But the execution should not be determined by derefencing it.  

**Rob Sanderson:** Why not simply specify that, if a server receives a profile URI that it does not know,  
… it just answers with 406?  
… We should not specify *how* the server does the serialization.  
… That's implementation detail, not specification.  
… Given that, I don't think there is any expectation that the server should dereference;  
… but it may do that if it thinks that's a good thing.  

**Benjamin Young:** the spec last week was explicitly specifying that the profile parameter should be dereferenced.  
… Going away from this lead us away from the profile parameter all together.  
… But I see where you are going.  

**Gregg Kellogg:** We should have both mechanisms: one to query a well known profile,  
… and one to provide a previously unknown context, to be processed by the server.  

**Rob Sanderson:** we can't prevent the profile from the accept header; it is part of the media-type.  
… We should embrace what people are going to do anyway,  
… which is a profile parameter in the accept header.  

**Benjamin Young:** I'm concerned we are defining a server API for JSON-LD, which is not what we are meant to do.  

> *Rob Sanderson:* +1 to bigbluehat to steer away from JSON-LD-REST

> *Rob Sanderson:* (not because it's a bad thing, but because we're not chartered to do that!)

**Benjamin Young:** We should provide a list of profile URI that we recommend.  
… Whatever else people use as profile URIs is their business.  
… The Links header is more an API spec, which would be LDP2's job, not ours...  

**Gregg Kellogg:** there was always a problem for the profile parameter for, e.g., compacted  
… there was no way to convey the context against which compaction was done [not sure I got it right]  
… This has been long discussed in the CG.  
… The Link header was a way to address that.  

**Benjamin Young:** Is this purely an IANA registration and suggesting good practices?  
… I fear that too much HTTP matter in the spec and/or the test,  
… will feel like a MUST or a SHOULD for any JSON-LD implementation.  

**Gregg Kellogg:** that's a way to ensure that people using it know how to use it.  
… The bit about the Link header could go in a different (REST?) spec or a best practices doc.  

> *Rob Sanderson:* +1 to best practices tests

**Gregg Kellogg:** We should remove any normative discussion about the Link header,  
… and replace it with a more vague mention to "header fields, to be described elsewhere".  
… And move the current test elsewhere, probably a new spec.

> ***Resolution #3: remove normative discussion of use of Link header usage for response augmentation--move to best practice for now***
{: #resolution3 .resolution}

**Gregg Kellogg:** Do we want to create new spec for server behaviour, or a best practices document?  
… And then should we create a different repository?  

**Ivan Herman:** I prefer many small repos, but I know not everyone agrees.  
… Wherever the editors feel it more conformable.  
… Should we close the issue?  

**Gregg Kellogg:** I still have a few changes to make.  
… After a small period for people to concur,  
… I'll merge the changes.  

**Ivan Herman:** and then close the issue at the same time.  

#### 3.2. Allow relative IRIs for @vocab
{: #section3-2}

> *Benjamin Young:* [https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-syntax/issues/72](https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-syntax/issues/72)

> - syntax - [https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-syntax/pull/114](https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-syntax/pull/114)
> - api - [https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-api/pull/58](https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-api/pull/58)

**Gregg Kellogg:** when we decided to satisfy the need for using the base as the @vocab,  
… I came up with the idea of using an empty string as @vocab.  
… When I implemented it, what I ended up doing was resolve @vocab as a relative URI against the base.  
… So why not allow that in the spec...  

> *Ivan Herman:* ship it! :-)

**Gregg Kellogg:** It is uncontroversial, as it does not change past behaviour.  
… Now you can simply use @vocab: "#", to use relative URIs everywhere.  

> *Rob Sanderson:* --> [https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-syntax/issues/72#issuecomment-433597475](https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-syntax/issues/72#issuecomment-433597475)

**Rob Sanderson:** is this the issue we discussed this during TPAC?  
… if you set vocab to `../#` and you had `example.org/ns` then you get `example.org/ns../#`  

**Gregg Kellogg:** I have to improve the text to indicate when standard URI resolution is used, and when string concatenation is used  

> **Proposed resolution: address security concerns related to relative URIs for @vocab in current PRs before closing #72** *(Benjamin Young)*
{: .proposed_resolution}

> *Ivan Herman:* +1

> *Benjamin Young:* +1

**Ivan Herman:** please close issue 72 when you clarify that and merge it.  

> *Gregg Kellogg:* +1

> *Rob Sanderson:* +1

**Ivan Herman:** Let's reduce the number of open issue  

> *Pierre-Antoine Champin:* +1

> *David I. Lehn:* +1

> ***Resolution #4: address security concerns related to relative URIs for @vocab in current PRs before closing #72***
{: #resolution4 .resolution}

> *Simon Steyskal:* +1

#### 3.3. HTML baseURI and @context?
{: #section3-3}

> *Benjamin Young:* [https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-api/issues/53](https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-api/issues/53)

**Benjamin Young:** please look at this before our next call,  

### 4. Misc.
{: #section4}

**Ivan Herman:** we should discuss which are the major issues we want to put on the agenda for the next F2F.  
… From the top of my head, there are the issues raised by danbri that we started discussing in Lyon.  

> *Gregg Kellogg:* Move issues into Discuss-F2F in the JSON-LD Management project
