**Gregg Kellogg:** There's a github user called `@vocab` who gets notified from minutes  

**Ivan Herman:** Don't think it's from the minutes  
… what triggers is if it's ... oh ... the transcript  

> *Gregg Kellogg:* ivan: it’s triggered by something in the comments.

**Benjamin Young:** Doesn't matter if it's robot or typed  
… If we can do that in the minutes, that would help.  
… I’ll either do it by hand, or try to update the software.  

**Rob Sanderson:** bigbluehat is keeper of the software stack, so he might note that.  

### 3. Logistics
{: #section3}

**Rob Sanderson:** I’ve reached out to Folger a couple of times to confirm that we can use the space, and they haven’t yet responded. I believe that everything’s fine, but I haven’t yet canceled the meeting space at Dupont circle.  
… Eric, contact at Folger, needed to validate with their events people, but we havne’t gotten the final word, yet.  

**Ivan Herman:** I see a mail from Sophie, who has confirmed it.  

**Rob Sanderson:** So, we’ll definitely be there, and I’ll let Dupont know.  

> ***Action #2: Rob Sanderson to update the web page***
{: #action2 .action}

**Rob Sanderson:** There are several places near the Folger we can go for dinner.  

### 4. Issues - Sealed Contexts
{: #section4}

> *Rob Sanderson:* Github issue: [https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-syntax/issues/20](https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-syntax/issues/20)

> *Ivan Herman:* Related issues: [https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-syntax/issues/98](https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-syntax/issues/98) and [https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-syntax/issues/108](https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-syntax/issues/108)

**Rob Sanderson:** We want to have it such that contexts that are processed after sealed contexts are unable to change the definition of terms.  
… So, if you see something like “foo” in the context, you can be confident of its meaning from the sealed context.  
… There is also the desire to “unseal” sealed terms. dlongley is champion from Credentidals WG.  

**Dave Longley:** The main reason for the feature is that there are a number of specifications that add prose to text about order of contexts, and that you can extend the context, but may not override terms. There’s no mechanism to enforce this.  

> *Rob Sanderson:* An example of such language: [https://iiif.io/api/presentation/2.1/#linked-data-context-and-extensions](https://iiif.io/api/presentation/2.1/#linked-data-context-and-extensions)

**Dave Longley:** People sometimes don’t use JSON-LD processors, and could interpret the data differently then those using JSON-lD procesors.  

> *Rob Sanderson:* And: [https://iiif.io/api/presentation/3.0/#45-linked-data-context-and-extensions](https://iiif.io/api/presentation/3.0/#45-linked-data-context-and-extensions)

**Dave Longley:** The other issue is related: we want a base context to define terms, and call-out an area where you can clear out the sealed contexts. You could use a scoped context to define a new scoped context for whatever is under that term.  

**Pierre-Antoine Champin:** I’m not sure I understand the use case for allowing people to unseal the context. My understanding is that, in some vocabularies, a term is an extension point, so that below that term the sealed context shouldn’t apply.  
… I’d understand the case where it’s always cleared, but not where it “could be”  

**Dave Longley:** Yes, it would be a clean-slate by definition.  

> *Benjamin Young:* [https://w3c.github.io/web-ledger/](https://w3c.github.io/web-ledger/)

> *Benjamin Young:* [https://github.com/digitalbazaar/jsonld-patch/tree/implementation](https://github.com/digitalbazaar/jsonld-patch/tree/implementation)

**Dave Longley:** The case for unsealing is used in web ledger, which allows you to store arbitrary data, and has know knowledge of being in a ledger.  
… In the case of json-ld patch, you want to be able to update arbitrary values in a document, in particular, if you want to be able to digitally sign patches.  
… You could use a scoped context for “value” to clear the context. It’s the case that you want a clean slate and allow users to override the context using embedded or scoped contexts.  

**Benjamin Young:** Conceptually, this feels like “important!” in CSS, to not allow things to be overridden.  
… I think dlongley’s point about how specs are written in the last couple of years is in play in so many places that a sealing mechanism is important.  

**David Newbury:** We talked about JSON literals before, could that be a way to handle content that is not associated with the context?  

**Dave Longley:** We looked at that, but it ends up being much more difficult, because of how signing works.  
… You’d end up having to canonicalize the JSON, and it becomes a mess. It avoids pitfalls where we want to avoid causing everything to be marked as a JSON literal.  

**Rob Sanderson:** In IIIF, we have the same wording, but it puts the contexts at the end, rather than the beginning, but we do want to have extension points.  
… Similarly, we use language maps, annotations uses string, we want those to be used together.  

**Gregg Kellogg:** Having something that prevents you from saying `@context` None would be inadvisable  
… it does what people have asked for to create the clean slate  
… it requires that values for terms to have their own context, so would need to be explicitly set  
… is there expectation about changing the default content is up higher.  
… If Annotations defines a term, `data`, and you want to unseal it. You add null as a scoped context  
… If you want to have the data in schema.org in `data`, you could do it with a scoped context that's an array with null as the first entry, but it's sealed  
… so the context needs to unseal itself  

**Ivan Herman:** The usage of “sealed” seems to be straightforward. I wonder about unsealing only appears when we talk about embedded contexts, is that correct?  
… If I have an array of contexts it’s different than if I have an embedded context.  

**Dave Longley:** I think that the main use case where you set context to null, should then allow the scoped context, or via an embedded context. If you defined “data” in a sealed context, you’d then say `"@context": null`, the second context could then define the term and introspects into the sealed context to see that the term can be overridden because it has a scoped context of null.  
… I think we should keep the cascading order we have.  

> *Rob Sanderson:* +1 to last in winning

**Dave Longley:** It can’t override terms, but can override scoping.  

**Rob Sanderson:** I think we can’t change definition order either.  

> *Dave Longley:* +1 to sealing individual terms

> *Jeff Mixter:* +1 to individual term sealing

> *Dave Longley:* (we've worked out some of these details in #98)

**Rob Sanderson:** what about sealing specific terms in a context? Then, we wouldn’t need to worry about unsealing different things.  
… What would current processors due if they had a …?  

> *Dave Longley:* `"data": {"@id": "foo:data", "@container": "@graph", "@context": null, "@sealed": true}` => enables a later `@context` to define: `"data": {"@context": "..."}`

> *Dave Longley:* 
> ```json
> "data": {
>      "@id": "foo:data", 
>      "@container": "@graph", 
>      "@context": null, "@sealed": true
>}
>``` 
>=> enables a later `"@context` to define: `"data": {"@context": "..."}`


> *Rob Sanderson:* 
> ```json
> "@context": [
>     {
>         "data": {
>             "@id": "eg:data", 
>             "@sealed": false
>         }
>     },
>     {
>         "data": {
>             "@context": "http://example.org/data-context.jsonld"
>         }
>     }
> ]
> ```

**David Newbury:** The only place I can unseal something is within the context that seals it. I can’t add something that unseals something that had previously been sealed.  

> *Rob Sanderson:* -1 to restricting to graph containers

**Benjamin Young:** I about how we can express this so that the behavior is obvious.  

> *Rob Sanderson:* E.g. An LDP implementation for Annotations should not require a graph container to put an annotation in a page

**Benjamin Young:** Perhaps something the scopes the sealing to the term, the content, or something else.  
… Perhaps the `@sealed` could have different values?  

> *Benjamin Young:* `"@sealed": "@id"`

> *Benjamin Young:* `"@sealed": "@context"`

> *Jeff Mixter:* maybe we can walk through the IIIF use case in DC next month

> *Dave Longley:* I think we can safely add `"@sealed": "`<foo>`"` (in a backwards compatible way) if we find that `"@sealed": true` is insufficient for use cases

**Rob Sanderson:** My understanding is that if you seal a context (or a set of terms), you’re only sealing the terms it defines. You could have a term outside that context can do whatever it wants, including override terms that would have come from an inherited context.  

> *Rob Sanderson:* `{"data2": {"@context": {"data":  ... }}`

**Rob Sanderson:** If `“data2”` is defined in a separate context, and within that you define `“data”`, that could conflict with a sealed `“data”` term.  

**Dave Longley:** If you tried to use that I would expect that to be an error.  

**Pierre-Antoine Champin:** I’m not a fan of sealing or unsealing individual terms, saying `"@sealed": false` would not be good.  

**Jeff Mixter:** What if someone want’s to just point at a different context and seal it, but you want to also import additional contexts, wouldn’t that lead to different errors or collisions?  

> *Pierre-Antoine Champin:* -1 to sealing someone else's context

**Rob Sanderson:** I don’t think you can seal someone else’s context.  

> *Jeff Mixter:* so sealing contexts is only within the context of the JSON-ld document?

> *Rob Sanderson:* jeff_mixter: Yep.

**Ivan Herman:** Perhaps dlongley or someone else could come up with a strawman spec text that we can look at. We’re getting lost.  

> *Ivan Herman:* [https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-syntax/issues/98#issuecomment-443182908](https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-syntax/issues/98#issuecomment-443182908) and the last example of [https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-syntax/issues/98#issuecomment-443241467](https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-syntax/issues/98#issuecomment-443241467)

**Ivan Herman:** These discussions in November we had (see [#98/comment-443182908](https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-syntax/issues/98#issuecomment-443182908) and the last example of [#98/comment-443241467](https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-syntax/issues/98#issuecomment-443241467) a table to talk about different ways to seal, and this seems to give a core spec; if it can be written down, we may have something.  
… If it becomes spaghetti, we have a problem.  
… We have the F2F in three weeks, so maybe we can have a goal to have a final resolution then.  

**Dave Longley:** We’d also want test cases so we can experiment with test cases.  
… We intend to implement one way or another.  

**Rob Sanderson:** I’m happy to contribute examples.  

> *Jeff Mixter:* so this is not valid - `{ "@context": [{"@vocab": "http://schema.org/", "@sealed": true}]`?

**Ivan Herman:** We can also use the wiki page.  

> ***Action #3: Rob Sanderson to document simple input and expected processing of them***
{: #action3 .action}

> ***Action #4: Dave Longley to review azaroth's text and add further examples***
{: #action4 .action}

> *Dave Longley:* +1

> *Benjamin Young:* +1

> *Dave Longley:* jeff_mixter: I think as a first cut of this feature you'd have to seal all of the schema.org terms yourself (defining them yourself in your own `@context`)

**Ivan Herman:** That’s discussed in #108; there was a syntax that might allow for that.  

> *Ivan Herman:* [https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-syntax/issues/108#issuecomment-447629312](https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-syntax/issues/108#issuecomment-447629312)

**Ivan Herman:** I didn’t realize I was sealing it, but it could be done. I’m not sure we want to do that.  

> *Dave Longley:* thanks everyone for the discussion!

**Rob Sanderson:** It’s been a useful discussion.  

**Dave Longley:** I can probably dial into the F2F.
