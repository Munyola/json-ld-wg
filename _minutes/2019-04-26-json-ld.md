### 2. Announcements / Reminders
{: #section2}

**Rob Sanderson:** any announcements/reminders?  

**Benjamin Young:** fyi, Ivan and I will be at the publishing WG f2f in a couple of days  
… json-ld is talking a rather important role there  
… would be helpful to have some review/comments on their work  

**Ivan Herman:** from now on, the minutes I'll create will have schema.org mark up in it too  

### 3. Scoping of 1.1 issues
{: #section3}

**Ivan Herman:** we will have to mark up the issues properly  
… at the end of the day we have to report what we plan to do  

**Rob Sanderson:** now that we are at the point of deciding what issues to tackle and what not  
… I'm fine with changing the label  
… we have 3 issues in syntax, 1 in api and 2 in framing currently labelled as deferred  

#### 3.1. several frames in the same document
{: #section3-1}

> *Rob Sanderson:* link: [https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-framing/issues/38](https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-framing/issues/38)

**Rob Sanderson:** are we still agreeing that we don't do this particular issue in the scope of the current wg?  

**Gregg Kellogg:** SPARQL 1.2 CG discusses framing in the context of construct queries  
… I'm fine with deferring

{: #section3-2}

> *Ivan Herman:* link: [https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-framing/issues/29](https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-framing/issues/29)

**Rob Sanderson:** idea is that framing starts with a tree, but if you don't know where a class starts in a tree then things get complicated  
… likely would require multiple frames within a frame document

#### 3.3. context by reference with metadata
{: #section3-3}

> *Rob Sanderson:* link: [https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-syntax/issues/108](https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-syntax/issues/108)

**Rob Sanderson:** metadata specified in a document without context  
… this has been asked for and discussed (as it has some privacy/security implications)  
… we need to have a good answer for not doing it, if we do so  

**Ivan Herman:** the example given in the issue is now outdated  
… is there any other example that would require this? (other than the SRI one)  

**Rob Sanderson:** I don't.. other than comment, description, etc.  

**Gregg Kellogg:** by providing metadata one might not to have to download a context  
… just verify that the remote context hasn't changed  

**David Newbury:** the other thing we talked about was finding documentation about contexts  

**Ivan Herman:** back to the various URI schemes, if we use that argument then some people might raise some eyebrows  
… as most of those schemes are more or less experimental  
… but we can say that it would require fundamentally new syntax to be able to handle those metadata, hence deferring  

> *Rob Sanderson:* +1 that this would be a bigger change than a .1 ; and to refer abstractly to other work

**Dave Longley:** I think we can refer to other work that's going on in that space  
… not necessarily say one has to use them

{: #section3-4}

> *Ivan Herman:* [https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-syntax/issues/86](https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-syntax/issues/86)

**Rob Sanderson:** answer is no  

**Ivan Herman:** I propose this issue can simply be closed by referring to the previous issue

{: #section3-5}

> *Rob Sanderson:* link: [https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-syntax/issues/128](https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-syntax/issues/128)

> *Simon Steyskal:* [ivan contemplating about issue 128]

**Ivan Herman:** there was some activity on this issue in February  
… there is a comment on it from pchampin providing a solution and asking whether that's valid  
… idk though  

**Gregg Kellogg:** I think I had an action on looking into interaction with nest/container stuff  
… we def. need a dedicated section on graphs/trig etc. in the bpr document  

**Ivan Herman:** then let's leave it open for now

#### 3.6. Streaming Profiles for JSON-LD to/from RDF
{: #section3-6}

> *Rob Sanderson:* link: [https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-api/issues/5](https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-api/issues/5)

**Rob Sanderson:** this came from the community group  

**Ivan Herman:** what does a profile mean?  

**Gregg Kellogg:** I reckon in the sense of serializing json-ld in a way that it's easier for stream processors to deal with it  
… or how would you create json-ld from a stream  
… the best thing we can do is to provide requirements that should be followed  

**Ivan Herman:** so not like profiles in the http context  

**Ruben Taelman:** basically like gkellogg described  
… I'm more than happy to summarize this in the best practice document  

> *Dave Longley:* +1 to doing this in best practices

**Simon Steyskal:** I don't think it should be normative. You can do what you want. But it's perfectly fine for a best practices document and should be in there, giving guidelines on this.  

**Gregg Kellogg:** the one thing I'm not sure whether we can move to a bp document is something that allows one to require stream data (?)  

**Ivan Herman:** I would propose to leave it to best practice  

**Tim Cole:** I'm a little concerned that by not following gkellogg's suggestions people will create json-ld that cannot be used properly by a streaming processor  

**Adam Soroka:** we frequently get questions about streaming json-ld  
… I second the concern timCole raised  

> *Benjamin Young:* [https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-bp/issues/3](https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-bp/issues/3)

**Benjamin Young:** a lot of the stuff I'm reading there is about key ordering  
… one potential option could be not to require ordering  
… but processors outputting a preferred ordering  

**Ivan Herman:** I hear bigbluehat's argument which is perfectly valid, and maybe a future version of json-ld will have key ordering  

> *Rob Sanderson:* +1  - unordered keys are ordered by necessity of a serialization

**Gregg Kellogg:** serialization vs. data model wrt. ordering  

> *Tim Cole:* +1 to ivan since it will provide experience to inform normalization

**Ivan Herman:** I repeat what I just said, getting into a normative thing in that area is probably premature  
… or too much work  

**Rob Sanderson:** what's the happy middle ground? key ordering for streaming?  

**Benjamin Young:** I would like to get as much as possible into the best practice document  

**Ruben Taelman:** scoped contexts shouldn't be an issue  
… as long as they are the first object

### 4. context response as HTML
{: #section4}

> *Rob Sanderson:* link: [https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-api/issues/66](https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-api/issues/66)

**Rob Sanderson:** what happens if you deref. a context and you get back HTML  
… currently it's an error  
… however we opened the door of dealing with HTML within json-ld  
… is it justified though?  

**Gregg Kellogg:** we did look to this as part of our solution on how to document json-ld  
… I created an example as part of one of the pull requests  
… what does this mean in terms of processing  
… you get HTML turn that into JSON and pass that to the processor  
… where that didn't work was with contexts  
… related to WebIDL section of the api spec that discusses framing (?)  

> *David Newbury:* workergnome_ has joined #json-ld

**Rob Sanderson:** having a context that self-documents with HTML seems like a potential benefit  
… if you don't want to have HTML then just use content negotiation to request json only  

**Benjamin Young:** web of things/credentials/etc. more than likely won't ship with dom parsers  
… if there's a way of making html parsing more modular  
… or at least not making it a requirement, would be preferred  

> *Dave Longley:* +1 to everything bigbluehat just said

**Ivan Herman:** if I don't care about the implementation, and that I can use json-ld with HTML  
… user's might be confused when they can actually use json-ld+html  

**Benjamin Young:** if there's any req. that a context stays the same (e.g. for hashing or what not) than you would properly not want to have it in HTML  
… verifiable claims would properly freak out if they have to include a dom parser too  
… if there's a way to achieve this in the api spec, then +1!  

> *Dave Longley:* perhaps we can have a conformance class around document loaders and push everything that way—and say that you have to use a document loader that understands JSON-LD in HTML if you want to support that, and then we don't need two specs, just more conformance classes around document loaders (maybe)

**Gregg Kellogg:** wondering whether we can actually pull the HTML part out into an own spec, or define a profile for it
