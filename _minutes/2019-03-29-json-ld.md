### 2. Introductions
{: #section2}

**Rob Sanderson:** we have delayed Ruben's introduction  

**Rob Sanderson:** working on the usability of linked data, including with JSON-LD  

**Gregg Kellogg:** presently with Specops; involved with JSON-LD since the beginning  

**Adam Soroka:** Apache Software Foundation  

**Pierre-Antoine Champin:** Pierre Antoine, Associate Prof at University of Lyon, Research includes sem web, lod, and interest in JSON-LD joined after last TPAC in Lyon  

**rubenworks:** from Ghent University; research on publishing and querying LD on the Web  
… I implement a streaming JSON-LD processor  

**David I. Lehn:** from Digital Bazaar; long involved with JSON-LD  

**Dave Longley:** also Digital Bazaar; one of the co-creators of JSON-LD, and implementor  

**Tim Cole:** UIUC library; worked with JSON-LD in the Annotation WG, and increasingly using it  

**Ivan Herman:** W3C staff contact, former lead of the Semantic Web activity  

### 3. Announcements/ Reminders
{: #section3}

**Rob Sanderson:** we have reserved Thursday/Friday for our meeting at TPAC in September  
… we can cancel it if it turns out that too few people can join (possibly because we will be advanced enough)  

**Ivan Herman:** we should set a date to make that decision  
… probably around 1st of July  

> ***Action #1: facilitate decision by July 1 for TPAC (Rob Sanderson)***
{: #action1 .action}

**Gregg Kellogg:** we should see if we want to liaise with other groups during TPAC  

**Rob Sanderson:** next week, EU/UK will have switched to DST, so the teleconf will be back to the usual time  

### 4. Issues
{: #section4}

#### 4.1. Defining term without `@id`
{: #section4-1}

> *Rob Sanderson:* Link: [https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-syntax/issues/129](https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-syntax/issues/129)

**Rob Sanderson:** we discussed this in the F2F in Washington DC  
… as part of 116 (allow redefinition of terms), but reducing it  

**Gregg Kellogg:** the original issue was about redefining a term without `@id` in the term definition  
… I did a few experiment; this should be fairly straightforward  

**Ivan Herman:** this would radically change the behaviour compared to 1.0,  
… which we are not allowed to be done.  

**Gregg Kellogg:** no, it fails in 1.0, so this is not backward incompatible per se  

> *Dave Longley:* +1 to mark as editorial for gregg to markup (also, thanks gregg!)

**Rob Sanderson:** is it just editorial, or do we need to discuss how it works?  

**Gregg Kellogg:** it should be mostly editorial  

**Pierre-Antoine Champin:** if I set "foaf:knows" to an exotic URI, then redefine "foaf:knows" without an `@id`, does the new definition inherit the exotic URI, or is it back to what "foaf:knows" resolves to?  
… ex: `[{"foaf:knows": {"@id": "http://hahaha.org/foo"}, {"foaf:knows": {"@type": "@id"}]`  

**Gregg Kellogg:** this kind of redefinition is an anti-pattern, possibly even an attack  
… so may be we should consider it as a bug in 1.0 and publish an errata to fix it  

**Dave Longley:** I'm in favour of fixing security issues  

> ***Action #2: make an issue for security issue on IRI as term definition (Gregg Kellogg)***
{: #action2 .action}

**Gregg Kellogg:** I even think there's some special logic when the term is an absolute IRI, which we can possibly remove  

#### 4.2. Sealing and Order  (propose close, no issue)
{: #section4-2}

> *Rob Sanderson:* Link:  [https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-syntax/issues/153](https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-syntax/issues/153)

**rubenworks:** I was reading the new 1.1 features, including sealing (now renamed protected)  
… the example shows a property defined as sealed, then a second definition fails to override it  
… but it was not entirely clear to me whether this worked when reversing the order of the definitions  
… but pchampin pointed out that the spec reads "prevent *further* redefinitions"  
… may be it would still be good to add an example to make it clearer  

> *Dave Longley:* +1 editorial, we're in agreement

**Rob Sanderson:** it is mostly editorial  

**Gregg Kellogg:** I think there are already many examples  
… maybe a test case would be better here  

**Ivan Herman:** this could be mentioned in the Best Practices document  
… I'm always the guy who asks for more examples, but in this case I agree with gkellogg  

> **Proposed resolution: Close #153, no issue, no editorial change needed in the spec.** *(Rob Sanderson)*
{: .proposed_resolution}

> *Rob Sanderson:* +1

> *Ruben Taelman:* +1

> *Pierre-Antoine Champin:* +1

> *Gregg Kellogg:* +1

> ***Resolution #2: Close #153, no issue, no editorial change needed in the spec.***
{: #resolution2 .resolution}

#### 4.3. @container [`@id`, `@set`]
{: #section4-3}

> *Rob Sanderson:* Link:  [https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-syntax/issues/140](https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-syntax/issues/140)

**Rob Sanderson:** this issue questions the relevance of `@container` [`@id`, `@set`]  
… many people have answered, in the line of "it's a feature, not a bug"  

> **Proposed resolution: Close #140 as a feature not a bug - no need to use it if you don't want it, and gives consistency** *(Rob Sanderson)*
{: .proposed_resolution}

> *Rob Sanderson:* +1

> *Gregg Kellogg:* +1

> *Dave Longley:* +1

> *Tim Cole:* +1

> *David Newbury:* +1

**Gregg Kellogg:** it is about consistency and orthogonality, despite the lack of use case  

> *Pierre-Antoine Champin:* +1

> *Ruben Taelman:* +1

> *Adam Soroka:* +1

> *Ivan Herman:* +1

> ***Resolution #3: Close #140 as a feature not a bug - no need to use it if you don't want it, and gives consistency***
{: #resolution3 .resolution}

> *David I. Lehn:* +1

#### 4.4. (Not) removing `@omitdefault`
{: #section4-4}

> *Rob Sanderson:* Link: [https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-framing/issues/41](https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-framing/issues/41)

> *Rob Sanderson:* Link: [https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-framing/issues/46](https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-framing/issues/46)

**Gregg Kellogg:** I already closed issues 41 and 46 (framing) which I raised myself  

#### 4.5. Keywords / Flags
{: #section4-5}

> *Ivan Herman:* link: [https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-framing/issues/37](https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-framing/issues/37)

**Rob Sanderson:** would we have complete parity between keywords and flags?  

> **Proposed resolution: Close #37, only edge cases when there is disparity** *(Rob Sanderson)*
{: .proposed_resolution}

> *Rob Sanderson:* +1

**Ivan Herman:** we have the parity for most of them;  

> *Ivan Herman:* +1

> *Dave Longley:* +1

> *Ruben Taelman:* +1

> *Gregg Kellogg:* +1

> *Tim Cole:* +1

**Ivan Herman:** those were we don't are edge cases, so I'm fine with closing it  

> *Pierre-Antoine Champin:* +1

> *David Newbury:* +1

> *David I. Lehn:* +1

> ***Resolution #4: Close #37, only edge edge cases when there is disparity***
{: #resolution4 .resolution}

> *Adam Soroka:* +1

#### 4.6. Indexing without a predicate
{: #section4-6}

> *Rob Sanderson:* Link:  [https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-syntax/issues/19](https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-syntax/issues/19)

**Rob Sanderson:** we discussed at the F2F  
… there was an action of gkellogg and pchampin to look into it  

**Gregg Kellogg:** I didn't have time to look into it yet  

**Pierre-Antoine Champin:** me neither  

**Rob Sanderson:** when an item appears randomly in multiple places in the document,  
… it would be nice to put this item in a kind of "bucket" where its full description is stored,  
… rather than to have to browse the full document to find the random place where the full description is included  

**Ivan Herman:** this is essentially the 'itemref' feature of microdata  
… copying that mechanism in JSON-LD seems complicated, but maybe not impossible  

**Dave Longley:** sounds like a framing issue, similar to `"@anywhere"`  

**Rob Sanderson:** this is not only related to framing, you need something in the context as well  

**Gregg Kellogg:** this is indeed very much like 'itemref'  
… my concern is that it will be complicated if we want to ensure round-trip (compaction/expansion)  
… like we do for other features  
… that could be done using default and framing, but seems like a very complex solution  

> *Dave Longley:* we do have special keywords in the framing compaction algorithm that are treated differently to avoid dropping undefined terms, etc.

**David Newbury:** is there a way to handle this as a post-processing step?  

**Gregg Kellogg:** the RDFa reference mechanism involves looking in the graph, adding triples and remove triples that were part of the pattern  

**Ivan Herman:** if we do that (i.e., reproduce the RDFa ref mechanism) people will run away screaming  
… what we are trying to do is some sort of internal references, essentially relative URIs  
… it would still require to define a bush and not a tree, which forces us to use `@graph`,  
… but it might work  

**Dave Longley:** if we consider working in memory, consider `@link` which is implemented in the Javascript processor  
… to ensure that an object is stored only in one place  

**Gregg Kellogg:** the problem is that you would typically create cycles internally  
… I'm not sure relative URIs can be used without introducing a level of indirection  

> ***Action #3: propose a concrete solution, considering link and nest (Rob Sanderson)***
{: #action3 .action}

> ***Action #4: propose a concrete solution, considering link and nest (David Newbury)***
{: #action4 .action}

**Gregg Kellogg:** if we are moving towards better support for streaming profiles  
… we can't rely on in-memory storage only  
… You would need a lot of bookkeeping to handle this.  

### 5. Adjourn
{: #section5}

**Rob Sanderson:** next week, we will talk about the Primer / Best Practices document
