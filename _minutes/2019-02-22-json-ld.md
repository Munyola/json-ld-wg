### 2. Announcements / Reminders
{: #section2}

#### 2.1. Heading to Candidate Recommendation (CR) - Calling all Implementers
{: #section2-1}

**Benjamin Young:** we are heading towards CR  
… consequently we are looking for as many implementers as we can  
… end of march?  

**Ivan Herman:** I think we started with the start of march but pushed it back to the end  

**Gregg Kellogg:** I think we wanted to wait for the next draft to come out before moving to CR  

**Benjamin Young:** azaroth and I wanted to do a blog post on that too  

> *Gregg Kellogg:* Test suite for the API -> [https://w3c.github.io/json-ld-api/tests/](https://w3c.github.io/json-ld-api/tests/)

> *Gregg Kellogg:* Test suite for the Framing -> [https://w3c.github.io/json-ld-framing/tests/](https://w3c.github.io/json-ld-framing/tests/)

**Gregg Kellogg:** link to test description  

**Benjamin Young:** I guess the API is the one to implement right?  

**Gregg Kellogg:** there's also one for framing  

**Benjamin Young:** we need 2+ implementations for each feature  

**Rob Sanderson:** quick question -> for the distinction between api and syntax  
… what if you would implement a total diff. api but still use the correct syntax  
… do we allow for that? or do we only accept if you implement the syntax complying to our api spec?  

**Ivan Herman:** the way I would present it -> the test suite we have is to some extent a test suite for the syntax, too  
… so I wouldn't necessarily tie it to the api only  
… I would expect that the test suite has examples for each feature of the syntax  

**Gregg Kellogg:** we certainly have to check our test suites  
… other RDF serialization tests usually don't distinguish between processing and syntax tests  
… exception might be NTriples  
… we also have some negative syntax tests if I recall correctly  

**Ivan Herman:** just saying that we have to be careful on how to present this  
… also, we do have to know whether we have deployment plans for the new features  
… we have introduced quite a few features, have to provide proof to some extent that those are really needed and planned to be implemented  

> *Rob Sanderson:* +1 to Ivan and Gregg

**Gregg Kellogg:** maybe we should go through the issue tracker and document planned implementations of the various features  

**Benjamin Young:** if you round-trip through compacting, you might be able to proof compliance with respective algorithm  

**Simon Steyskal:** I was wondering, we said that we like there's proof that features will be implemented, and realized this is related to the syntax document.  
… this is why we have tests and implementation requirements, to provide the proof. But we don't have tests for syntax, so is this why we need to do this?  

**Ivan Herman:** An implementation looks at the JSON-LD in general and implements those things, is disjoint from whether it will be used  

**Simon Steyskal:** Oh, okay. I thought you were fine showing 2 implementations, so not at risk  

**Ivan Herman:** Yes, but here we have to show the extensions are needed, as it's from existing spec  

**Gregg Kellogg:** e.g. nested  

**Ivan Herman:** And it might not be needed, I try to understand how the director might react  

**Gregg Kellogg:** We have multiple implementations of nested properties, but why do we have them at all?  
… it comes from uses in the wild, which would be good to document  

#### 2.2. Upcoming call with TAG members on March 1st
{: #section2-2}

**Benjamin Young:** next week we'll have 2-3 members joining from TAG  

> *Dave Longley:* +1 to documenting the purpose for each feature (and put it in the introduction for each feature in the spec)

**Benjamin Young:** esp. for discussing the relation between json-ld <-> HTML  
… how DOM is affected etc.  

### 3. Issues
{: #section3}

**Rob Sanderson:** we got through the vast majority of the issues  
… we should also go through the @base issue in prep. for next week  

#### 3.1. Keywords for options
{: #section3-1}

> *Simon Steyskal:* [https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-framing/issues/37](https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-framing/issues/37)

**Rob Sanderson:** ivan asks why there isn't a keyword for all the different options  

**Ivan Herman:** I realized by reading through the document that certain options appeared as keywords  
… others don't  

**Gregg Kellogg:** I think there are if you look at the syntax tokens  

> *Gregg Kellogg:* [https://w3c.github.io/json-ld-framing/#framing-keywords](https://w3c.github.io/json-ld-framing/#framing-keywords)

**Ivan Herman:** not sure I remember reading this  

**Gregg Kellogg:** we very well may have examples that don't use all the keywords  

> *Rob Sanderson:* > Initialize flags embed, explicit, and requireAll from object embed flag, explicit inclusion flag, and require all flag in state overriding from any property values for `@embed`, `@explicit`, and `@requireAll` in frame.

**Ivan Herman:** yeah the examples in the syntax document were way more extensive  

> *Dave Longley:* was just going to say our implementation has those flags in there (and there may be tests as well... at least i hope so) :)

**Gregg Kellogg:** my thought initially was that framing would eventually be incorporated in the API document  
… but we decided to leave it in a sep. doc  
… so there's a backlog of things that have to happen to the document  

> *Tim Cole:* Does 4.1 include `@omit-graph`?

**Ivan Herman:** clearly, if we add more examples to the document then this should fix it  

> **Proposed resolution: Close Framing #37, as already fixed** *(Rob Sanderson)*
{: .proposed_resolution}

**Gregg Kellogg:** there is an open issue I'm working against  

> *Rob Sanderson:* +1

> *Pierre-Antoine Champin:* +1

**Gregg Kellogg:** no it's in 4.4.3.3  

**Benjamin Young:** is it a keyword? or an option for the api?  

**Gregg Kellogg:** well we have keywords for all the options  

> **Proposed resolution: Keep #37 open for `@omit-graph`** *(Rob Sanderson)*
{: .proposed_resolution}

> *Simon Steyskal:* +1

> *Ivan Herman:* +1

> *Rob Sanderson:* +1

> *Tim Cole:* +1

> *Benjamin Young:* +1

> *Dave Longley:* +1 ... naming convention appears to be camelCase so `@omitDefault`

> *Gregg Kellogg:* +1

**Gregg Kellogg:** values can have multiple elements (array) part of the reason why this complicates native json support  

> *David I. Lehn:* +1

> *David Newbury:* +1

> ***Resolution #2: Keep #37 open for `@omit-graph`***
{: #resolution2 .resolution}

#### 3.2. [syntax] Does HTML’s ``<base>`` effect `@context` IRI resolution?
{: #section3-2}

> *Simon Steyskal:* [https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-syntax/issues/134](https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-syntax/issues/134)

**Rob Sanderson:** which we will talk about with TAG next week  

**Rob Sanderson:** [explains example in issue]  

**Benjamin Young:** the nuance here is related to the potential dynamic nature  
… the URI spec already outlines that base would also be resolved  
… as it's HTML  

**Gregg Kellogg:** I think we do need to find someone who's more familiar with HTML  
… esp. wrt. dynamic changes  
… when I was going through this, I seem to recall that in 1.0 we discussed how to deal with a remote context which references another remote context, to what shall this context be relative to?  

**Ivan Herman:** the interpretation of the json-ld content must be done on load  
… before anything else is done  

> *Pierre-Antoine Champin:* I'm not sure that we can guarantee that nothing is done before on load

**Rob Sanderson:** wanted to highlight that this is likely to be a security issue  
… should flag it as such  
… e.g. if you could change a verifiable claim  

**Rob Sanderson:** not sure how we could enforce the on load stuff  
… or test it  

**Ivan Herman:** I'm surprised that this wasn't an issue anywhere else  

> *Benjamin Young:* [https://w3c.github.io/json-ld-syntax/#example-120-using-the-document-base-url-to-establish-the-default-base-iri](https://w3c.github.io/json-ld-syntax/#example-120-using-the-document-base-url-to-establish-the-default-base-iri)

> *Benjamin Young:* [https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/infrastructure.html#dynamic-changes-to-base-urls](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/infrastructure.html#dynamic-changes-to-base-urls)

**Benjamin Young:** it actually was, see the links I posted  
… embedding the json-ld might be done with JS  
… search engine bots will wait until the page stops moving  
… but if I curl the page, I'll take whatever is in the document  
… if both things are in play, I might not be able to tell what data is actually shared then  
… pinning down when JSON-LD processing shall be done is the actual question here  

**Gregg Kellogg:** many applications use HTML as a syntax rather than a processing model  
… what if someone does depend on dynamic state changes  
… were different timings make things undecidable  
… if you look at pre-respec times for example  

> *Benjamin Young:* [https://github.com/w3c/respec/wiki/doJsonLd](https://github.com/w3c/respec/wiki/doJsonLd)

**Dave Longley:** we should probably assume that most pages add json-ld after it has loaded  
… we should provide clear guidance  

**Rob Sanderson:** does the signature take also all expanded information into account?  

**Dave Longley:** yes, the sign. requires expanding and converting to canonicalized RDF  
… if you don't to this you don't pass  

**Ivan Herman:** RDFa has a very similar problem, potentially  
… it doesn't say a word when processing has to be done  
… although I has the same issues  
… we should provide appropriate warnings  

> *Dave Longley:* +1 to what ivan said

**Ivan Herman:** I don't think we can do anything more than that  

**Benjamin Young:** maybe not relying on the base at all?  

**Gregg Kellogg:** no.. that would go against the RFC  

> *Dave Longley:* -1 to ignoring ``<base>`` etc — i don't think it will fly with anyone (+1 to Gregg)... could be wrong of course.

> *Ivan Herman:* +1 to gregg

**Tim Cole:** I agree with gkellogg that we have to use base  

> *Gregg Kellogg:* +1 to timCole Images don’t reload when base changes.

> *Ivan Herman:* +1 ti timCole

> *Dave Longley:* i.e. sound like an idea is to "lock in base" on read

**Benjamin Young:** part of the reason they don't change images is because they don't expect things to change  

**Tim Cole:** yes maybe we should adapt a similar approach  

> *Dave Longley:* I suspect we might want to see some use cases to understand expectations with Web Components and things of that nature to make the "right decision" here.

**Rob Sanderson:** what would we anticipate the big browsers would do if the json-ld changes  

> *Ivan Herman:* +1 to bigbluehat

**Benjamin Young:** we should be careful to be not prescriptive on when and how to run processing  
… but as said, provide guidance/info on what would happen  

> *Dave Longley:* +1 ... as long as people can understand what will happen when they do processing and can control when to do that processing (there is choice), i think we're ok.

> *Rob Sanderson:* +1

**Benjamin Young:** you have a lot of options  
… some of it is best practices  
… if you targeting curl then put it directly in the document  
… (for example)  

> *Pierre-Antoine Champin:* +1 to ivan, `@base` keeps you safe IMO

> *Dave Longley:* +1 ... use absolute URIs or `@base` to get "stable" resolution

**Rob Sanderson:** [providing possible proposals]  

**Rob Sanderson:** "if you don't do this, this are the possible ramifications"  
… we should explain the different scenarios and what would happen  

> **Proposed resolution: Recommend using absolute URIs or `@base` within JSON-LD if relative URI resolution is important, and add warnings to the spec for ramifications of using a potentially dynamic DOM for resolution or discovery of JSON-LD blocks** *(Rob Sanderson)*
