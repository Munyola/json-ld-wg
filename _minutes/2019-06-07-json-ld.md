### 2. Announcements / Reminders
{: #section2}

#### 2.1. TPAC
{: #section2-1}

**Rob Sanderson:** TPAC registration is open. Please remember to register before 21 June close to early registration  
… this is earlier than usual because TPAC is in Sept  
… any other announcements?  

#### 2.2. Horizontal Review
{: #section2-2}

**Ivan Herman:** we really need to get the horizontal reviews done in a timely fashion  
… don't expect issues but reviewers will appreciate if we get to these early  
… we need somebody for security and privacy  
… privacy wants our person to attend IG call and gives an overview  
… we would like people for horizontal reviews to volunteer asap  

**Rob Sanderson:** happy to volunteer (depending on time) but would be good to have Greg and others help  

**Pierre-Antoine Champin:** also happy to help but less comfortable about API  

**Ivan Herman:** Rob should send email to privacy group asking time when they can fit us on their agenda  
… probably Rob and pchampin for sure, Ivan and Greg as available  
… same thing for security - they'll come to us  
… for accessibility we start with their questionnaire  

> *Ivan Herman:* [https://w3c.github.io/apa/fast/checklist.html](https://w3c.github.io/apa/fast/checklist.html)

**Ivan Herman:** once this is done then we contact them as next step  

**Rob Sanderson:** one person will need to take lead on filling out questionnaire - others could be on irc to help  
… so, we should ask Greg about availability when he gets back  
… Rob and Pierre-Antoine will do best to make themselves available  
… other volunteers would be appreciated.  

#### 2.3. I18N
{: #section2-3}

**Ivan Herman:** we will need one more to work with internationalization  
… the big issue we may have is ability to add base string direction  
… (Rob should still contact soon to deal with any other issues)  

> *Rob Sanderson:* reference: [https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-syntax/issues/11](https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-syntax/issues/11)

**Ivan Herman:** with regard to string direction this is coming up with a lot of WGs and we have talked about it in this WG  
… we should discuss next week when Greg is back and we've had a little more time to catch up on topic  

> *Ivan Herman:* -> [https://w3c.github.io/rdf-dir-literal/](https://w3c.github.io/rdf-dir-literal/) discussion on direction issue

**Rob Sanderson:** any other issues or announcements  

### 3. Issues
{: #section3}

**Rob Sanderson:** tried to pick issues for this week less related to API and more related to syntax and policy  

#### 3.1. Profile IRIs
{: #section3-1}

> *Ivan Herman:* [https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-syntax/issues/170](https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-syntax/issues/170)

**Ivan Herman:** one background - transition calls with WOT people  
… they were interested in a profile for their own needs  
… but what came up is what is policy with regard to what is said in W3C documents  
… by default each WG has its own profile space (e.g., ns/jsonld...)  
… and that's it  

**Rob Sanderson:** there are profile URIs (e.g., Web Annotation)  
… if you don't understand it, you must ignore it  

> **Proposed resolution: Accept #170, with the clarification that processors MUST ignore IRIs that that they do not recognize, and that json-ld* IRIs are reserved for future WG use** *(Rob Sanderson)*

#### 3.2. Compact IRIs and URI Schemes
{: #section3-2}

> *Ivan Herman:* [https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-syntax/issues/177](https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-syntax/issues/177)

**Rob Sanderson:** we discussed this a few weeks ago, but only to point of introducing the issue.  
… hopefully people have thought about it  
… the issue is that IRI schemes that don't start with // are seen as compact IRIs  
… e.g., icon:... is seen as a compact IRI not a full IRI  
… we could define these as undefined (rather than a prefix)  
… this approach adds a little security without banning all non // schemes  

**Ivan Herman:** I don't fully understand - so in your example in the issue, what's the role of protected  

**Rob Sanderson:** avoids someone stealing the meaning of prefix (e.g., mailto:)  

**Benjamin Young:** the goal is to allow continued use of these kinds of IRI prefixes  

**Rob Sanderson:** having it in the context seems a good solution since it allows you to specify only the scope where you use the scheme rather than everywhere

**Benjamin Young:** yes, it is good to scope this  

**Pierre-Antoine Champin:** it seems to me the protected approach would not be very efficient  
… I'm not sure I fully grasp the use cases, but it seems you still get around protected  
… the only way to really protect against redirection of mailto: is to protect the individual properties (e.g., email)  

**Rob Sanderson:** so you say that email values not to be expected  

**Pierre-Antoine Champin:** not sure this requires anything additional since we already have prefix  
… seems a matter of best practice  

**Ivan Herman:** in the example you have two approaches nul and prefix=false  

**Rob Sanderson:** probably prefix=false, this works well since we already have prefix  

**Ivan Herman:** do we?  

**Rob Sanderson:** issue 76  

> *Rob Sanderson:* ref;: [https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-api/issues/76](https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-api/issues/76)

> *Pierre-Antoine Champin:* a more efficient protection would be `{ "email": { "@id": "http://example.org/emailAddress", "@type": "@id", "@protected": true, "@context": { "mailto": { "@prefix": false } } }`

**Rob Sanderson:** proposal was made to add prefix with 3 allowed values (one of which would be false, as required by issue 177)  
… the issue in doing this was that you need to have an `@id`, which is why we might still need `@id` null  
… seems like we shouldn't need that if prefix: false  
… Pierre-Antoine, does prefix: false already sufficient?  

**Pierre-Antoine Champin:** not sure  

**Ruben Taelman:** doesn't seem to work right now  

**Rob Sanderson:** but maybe it protects against intentional mischief  
… anyone willing to take action to verify that prefix: false does work or can be made to work?  

**Pierre-Antoine Champin:** okay, put this action on me  

> ***Action #2: test if `@prefix: false` without `@id` works as expected (Pierre-Antoine Champin)***
{: #action2 .action}

**David I. Lehn:** find it a little hard to understand the attack line here  
… if we assume all contexts are a risk, seems a bigger problem  
… protect should be more about extension and override  

**Rob Sanderson:** we have run into this issue with regard to content being incorrectly expanded  

**Benjamin Young:** not directly on point, but it feels like a lot of our issues have had to do with managing context intermingling  
… we may need to zoom out a little  
… while there are issues here it seems like its about trust of contexts, ownership of contexts, etc.  
… this fragility that is still there is where we may have issues with security and privacy reviews  
… I sometimes feel like we're applying pressure to the wrong part of the ecosystem  
… it's not clear the role and motivation of the actors  
… so maybe we need a broader view  
… would not be an issue if you always trusted the context file you reference  

**Rob Sanderson:** not certain about that. If you define `mailto:` you need to undefine it elsewhere in your instance  

**Benjamin Young:** so this is partly about remixing within instance / context  

**Rob Sanderson:** I think at least we need to determining how prefix: false works without `@id` or `@id: null`  
… need to be able to treat these as resource IRI when you want to  

**Ivan Herman:** I share bigbluehat's concerns in a general way  
… for this issue you are asking if prefix: false solves current issue  
… since prefix is a 1.1 key, we need it to work as we want and so if it's not working that way now, let's make it work  

> *Pierre-Antoine Champin:* the questions becoming: is it possible (i.e. not over-complicated) to implement `@prefix` to work like this

**Rob Sanderson:** the action should allow us to do this  

**Pierre-Antoine Champin:** i just realized during discussion we have already introduced redefining a term that looks like an IRI because no useful use case for doing this  
… in a way this desire to limit prefixes that are sometimes used as schemes  
… not clear how critical the use cases are  
… may confuse users to say some IRIs cannot be anything else, but some could be compact IRIs in disguise  

**Ivan Herman:** does this mean we should have a list of prefixes that are schemes?  

**Pierre-Antoine Champin:** no, trying hard not to say that  
… current rule is `scheme://`  
… and this is clear cut, non-ambiguous  
… it might be confusing to do this for non // schemes  

**Rob Sanderson:** so our approach is to leave this to context authors rather than trying to maintain a universal list  
… this will almost certainly come up in security horizontal review  
… it would be nice to solve or improve it  
… if prefix: false works, we're done  

> **Proposed resolution: If `@prefix: false` works, then we can turn 177 into a best practice.  If not, then 177 becomes an issue to improve `@prefix` to allow it.** *(Rob Sanderson)*

#### 3.3. IRI expansion
{: #section3-3}

> *Rob Sanderson:* ref: [https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-syntax/issues/191](https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-syntax/issues/191)

**Rob Sanderson:** essentially, what I took away from this issue is that what is wanted is a way to set defaults per prefix  
… e.g., everything with `x` prefix, everything is a list  
… since we declare intent to close to new features (after last published draft)  
… so, can we defer this?  
… or is it a bug we have to address  

**Benjamin Young:** the use of this seems to want ad hoc terms mixed in with the prefix declaration  
… the first example seems that way  
… seems he could get same result with slightly more verbose (less confusing) instance  

**Adam Soroka:** this reminds me of java server tags  
… not clear that this is something json-ld was supposed to do.  
… this seems to be about complex structures, almost transformative  
… this is not the focus of json-ld. important to do, but not really our intent here  

**Ivan Herman:** so what I understood from the issue is that this is not a bug, but really is a new feature  
… so the answer should simply be that we defer because of the feature freeze and avoid discussing the details  

**Adam Soroka:** should we send to CG  

**Ivan Herman:** since we are not closing issue, we don't need to send to CG  
… the person submitting may want to do so.  

> **Proposed resolution: Defer syntax#191 and api#94 as new features after feature freeze** *(Rob Sanderson)*
{: .proposed_resolution}

> *David Newbury:* +1

**Rob Sanderson:** will do same for issue in api

{: #resolution4 .resolution}

> ***Action #3: post blog reference for feature freeze (Rob Sanderson)***
{: #action3 .action}

**Ivan Herman:** please add to issue link to blog where we declared feature freeze  

**Rob Sanderson:** can we add mention of feature freeze in repos readme  

> ***Action #4: add feature freeze note to the syntax, api, and framing READMEs and issue template for bugs only (Benjamin Young)***
{: #action4 .action}

> *Tim Cole:* adjourn - next call in a week (azaroth regrets)
